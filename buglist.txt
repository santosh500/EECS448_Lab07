The four guesses for the bugs are:
1. The isEmpty() is flawed because it doesn't give the right status when empty based on test_isEmpty().
2. The size() function has errors due to the fact that it gave a size greater than the actual size of the LinkedList in test_size().
3. The addBack() function is not operating correctly because it gives the wrong value of the intended action after the execution of the function. This is noted in test_addback().
4. The removeFront() function is not operating correctly because it gives the wrong value of the intended action after the execution of the function. This is noted in test_removefront().
